    <h1>How did I make this Webpage?</h1>
    <p>1. First I downloaded the 3 major things. <b>Google Chrome, Sublime text and Github desktop</b> </p>
    <p>2. Next, I opened Github, made a file and opened it inside my code editor(sublime text)</p>
<p>3. After I have done this, I made it into a html file so it gets some color</p>
       <p>Now comes the coolest part. I added a Google link :</p>
<a href="https://google.com"target="_blank" title="Let's go to Google">click me ! I'm a link!</a>
    <p><font color="OOFFOO">
    4. Now you can add a Picture just like me 
</font>
</font>
<p>Dont forget to link your <b>Github desktop</b> with <b>Github.com</b> so you can publish your webpage</p>
    <p>I hope to see a webpage from you to<br>
    By the way this is my picture</p>
